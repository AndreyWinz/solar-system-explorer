# 🌌 Solar System Explorer

**Solar System Explorer** is an interactive 2D simulation of the solar system built entirely with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript — no external libraries required.  
It lets you explore celestial motion, zoom, pan, view information panels, and learn space science concepts like gravity, orbits, and distances.
